A Vim plugin for interacting with Heroku.  Yes really.  Provided is an :Hk command that wraps both the Heroku toolbelt and hk, with some pretty wicked tab complete for the latter.  Plus it adds a command wrapper for each Heroku remote in your Git config, so :Staging console is only a few keystrokes away.
